Files structure is a little messy, sorry for it. I had issues with formatting in Intellij.  
  
First few weeks are in separate folders, then after that the folder `Week 4` is the location for the remaining assignments/activities. They are named by the number of their activity, eg `Activity 8` would be in the location `/Week 4/Activity8`. Again, I apologize for the mess. Thank you for your help this semester.
