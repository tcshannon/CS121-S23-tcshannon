# Test Directory

This directory contains all of the JUnit test classes for the Pokemon game application. The test directory structure mirrors the directory structure of the main application, which makes it easy to organize and run the tests.  

Depending on the needs of this project, the test directory may or may not be used.  

For this project, the test directory descriptions were only provided in case of future tests outside the course.

## How to Run the Tests

To run the tests, you can use the built-in testing features of Intellij IDEA:

1. Open the project in Intellij IDEA.
2. Click on the "Run" menu and select "Run...".
3. In the dialog that appears, select "All Tests" and click "OK".
4. Intellij IDEA will automatically run all of the JUnit test classes in the test directory.

## Adding New Tests

To add a new JUnit test class, simply create a new Java class in the test directory that mirrors the package structure of the main application. Then, write your test cases in the new class.
Dependencies

The test directory has no external dependencies. However, it does depend on the main application code, so you should make sure that the main application code is working correctly before running the tests.
